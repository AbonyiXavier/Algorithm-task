# Task-1
- Your input is an array containing unsorted words. Suggest an efficient solution for implementing hasWord(word) which receives a word and returns true if it is in the array and false otherwise. You are not allowed to use JS Objects (maps) in your solution but can use Arrays. Solution time complexity is more important than its space complexity

# Task-2
- Implement preceding value in a LinkedList â€” Your function should receive a value and returns the preceding value in the linked list.
